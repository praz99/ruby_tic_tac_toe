## Rules For Tic-Tac-Toe

1. The game is played on a grid that is 3 by 3 squares.
2. It is a game of two players that use X and O to mark moves in empty squares.
3. The first player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
4. The game is over when all 9 squares are full. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
5. Below is a virtual implementation where marks can be placed by selecting from numbers 1 to 9 when prompted.

| (1) | (2) | (3) |
-------------------
| (4) | (5) | (6) |
-------------------
| (7) | (8) | (9) |
-------------------

6. A winning position would like the image below at the end. As soon as someone gets three of their marks in a row, the game ends.


|  O  |  X  |  O  | 
-------------------
|  X  |  X  |  X  |  --- *Player 'X' wins with this row!*
-------------------
|  O  |  O  |  O  |
-------------------

For a detailed explanation, please have a look at this [guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Tic-Tac-Toe).
